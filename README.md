Welcome to the grocery store exercise! Before you get started, please make sure you update the .env file with the appropriate store name, store website, and tax rate! I've included some preliminary env variables for emails, but those are a work in progress

The only additional imports you'll need are os, operator, dotenv, and datetime. If you're working on emails you'll also need sendgrid 

Happy shopping!
